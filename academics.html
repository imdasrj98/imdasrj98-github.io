      <ul>
        <br><li>A Machine Learning Approach to Predict the Location of Crime Using Date, Time and Class
of the Crime</li>
        <div class="details">
          This was our final year project for my Bachelors study, implementing the Multiple
Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression to predict the crime hotspot based
on the various features with an accuracy of 98%.
        </div>
        <br><li><a href="https://github.com/imdasrj98/A-Machine-Learning-Approcah-to-Analyze-the-statistics-of-Football-Players">A Machine Learning Approach to Analyze the Statistics of Football Players</a></li>
        <div class="details">
          In this project I tried to predict which players should be sold and which ones should
be retained by the team at the end of every season based on their performance and
other factors with SVM and KNN classifiers with approximately 80% accuracy
        </div>
        <br><li><a href="https://github.com/imdasrj98/Sign-Language-Detection-and-Conversion-to-Text-Using-CNN-and-OpenCV">Sign Language Detection and Convert to Text Using CNN and OpenCV</a>
          <div class="details">
            This ongoing project was implemented to identify American sign language images
using CNN and after detecting the alphabet convert it to text for future purpose. Also
to build a real time interface for using the model in real life applications using
OpenCV and other front end designing techniques.

        <br><li><a href="https://github.com/imdasrj98/Predictive-Analysis-on-Road-Accident-Risks-Based-on-Heterogeneous-Sparse-Data">Predictive Analysis on Road Accident Risks Based on Heterogeneous Sparse Data</a>
        </li>
        <div class="details">
          The intention of this ongoing project is to analyze this accidental data-set to identify
the accident hot spot areas and take appropriate measures to decrease the rate of
the accident and identify the situations in which the accident happens and take
precautions to prevent the accident.
        </div>
        <br><li><a href="https://github.com/imdasrj98/LoadBalancing">Performing Load Balancing in Virtual Machine in Simulated Cloud Environments.</a>
        </li>
        <div class="details">
          This ongoing project aims to have in depth discussion about the various load
balancing algorithms in distributed cloud system and analysis of which algorithm
gives the best outcome.
